## Relevant Projects
- [Hypoxia Prediction from scRNAâ€‘seq Data](https://github.com/FilippoRonzino/ai-lab): Predicting the oxygen level condition of cancer cells based on gene expression patterns. Extensive data analysis, data preprocessing and filtering, dimensionality reduction with PCA and UMAP. Developed a model comparison pipeline including various algorithms: XGBoost, KNN, Logistic regression, Random forest, SVM, Neural network. Employed ensemble methods and Kolmogorovâ€‘Arnold Networks.
- [Portfolio Creation and Optimization through Machine Learning](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://github.com/BSIC) to build a portfolio of stocks from the SP500 through ML. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, compared Mean-Variance and Mean-Entropy portfolio optimization.
