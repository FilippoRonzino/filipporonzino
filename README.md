## Relevant Projects
- [Visual Intuition in Time Series Forecasting: A CNN Approach Inspired by Human Perception](https://github.com/FilippoRonzino/machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence): Benchmarked 1D CNNs for direct numerical time series forecasting and 2D CNN autoencoders for extrapolating future sequences from visual (image-based) representations. Trained and evaluated models on both synthetic (harmonic signals, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes) and real-world datasets (ECG, S&P 500), with automated hyperparameter tuning via Population-Based Training (PBT).
- [Portfolio Creation and Optimization through Machine Learning](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://github.com/BSIC) to build a portfolio of stocks from the SP500 through ML. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, compared Mean-Variance and Mean-Entropy portfolio optimization. Refer to [Paper](https://bsic.it/portfolio-creation-and-optimization-through-machine-learning/) for more details.
- [Hypoxia Prediction from scRNAâ€‘seq Data](https://github.com/FilippoRonzino/ai-lab): Predicting the oxygen level condition of cancer cells based on gene expression patterns. Extensive data analysis, data preprocessing and filtering, dimensionality reduction with PCA and UMAP. Developed a model comparison pipeline including various algorithms: XGBoost, KNN, Logistic regression, Random forest, SVM, Neural network. Employed ensemble methods and Kolmogorovâ€‘Arnold Networks.
